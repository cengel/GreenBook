# GreenBook 1937 - Notes

The first book in the series is still limited to New York City (Harlem), and mainly contains businesses offering a variety of services to African Americans. They are formatted as little advertisements, instead of the simpler listings in later books. From p. 7: "'The Green Book' will pay $1 or more for manuscripts accepted by the publishers. Subjects based on the Negro motoring conditions, scenic wonders in your travels, places visited of interest and short stories on one's motoring experience."
