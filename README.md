# GreenBook

This repository contains business addresses I manually extracted from the [Negro Motorist Green Book Collection](http://digitalcollections.nypl.org/collections/the-green-book#/?tab=about) of the [Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture](http://www.nypl.org/locations/schomburg). I also have determined **latitude and longitude** for each address location as best as possible.

The table structure is:

* Service
* Name
* Street
* City
* State
* PageNo
* EditionYear
* Lat
* Lon
* Comments

Tables are provided as is, in `.ods` and `.csv` format. If you want to help, get in touch with me.
